List practice with python 3

# Handling lists in python3

#List name:
friends = ["Kevin", "Kate", "Jim", "Jim", "John", "Oscar", "Feebie"]

#printing list:
print(friends)

#make a copy of the list and print:
friends2 = friends.copy()
print(friends2)

#find the index of "Kevin"
print(friends.index("Kevin"))

#What position is "Kate" in?
print(friends[1])

#What are the ways you can add the element "Corey" to the list?
friends.append("Corey")
print(friends)

#Change the element "Kate" to "Jason" in the current list
friends[1] = "Jason"
print(friends)

#Add the element "Samantha" to index position 2 of the current list
friends.insert(2, "Samantha")
print(friends)

#Â®emove the element "Oscar" from the current list
friends.remove("Oscar")
print(friends)

#"Pop off" the last element of the list
friends.pop()
print(friends)

#Write the code to find out what the last element is of the list
print(friends[-1])

#Write the code to find out what the last 4 elements are of the list
print(friends[-4:])

#Write the code to find out what the first 2 elements are of the list
print(friends[:2])

#Clear the list
friends.clear()
print(friends)
