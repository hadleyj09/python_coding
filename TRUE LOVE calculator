#Lets create a TRUE LOVE Calculator to give a very accurate prediction on if you and your "crush" are meant to be. First, we have add up the number of times the letters T-R-U-E and L-O-V-E come up in both of your names. Next, you'll get a score! Are you ready?

name1 = input("Please enter your name here: ")
name2 = input("Please enter their name here: ")

both_names = name1 + name2
both_lower = both_names.lower()

print(f"Hello {name1} and {name2}! Let's see if you are a good match for one another.")


print(f"Your names together looks like this: {both_lower}. Time to calculate!")

t = both_lower.count('t')
r = both_lower.count('r')
u = both_lower.count('u')
e = both_lower.count('e')

true = t + r + u + e

l = both_lower.count('l')
o = both_lower.count('o')
v = both_lower.count('v')
e = both_lower.count('e')

love = l + o + v + e 

true_love = str(true) + str(love)

print(f"Congradulations! Your TRUE LOVE score is {true_love}! But what does this mean?")

if int(true_love) < 10 or int(true_love) > 90:
  print("You both go together like bananas and chunky soup.")
elif int(true_love) > 40 and int(true_love) < 60:
  print("Ehhhhh....Maybe you won't destroy each other...Good luck!")
else:
  print("Welp......Let's see where this goes")

print("Did you have fun?")
